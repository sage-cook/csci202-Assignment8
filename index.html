		<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
		<div id="main">
			<p>
				For my final project I intend to code a web game of a similar genre to games like A Dark Room, The Candy Box 2, Universal Paperclips or Bead Machine. These are all games which inspired me in my youth and I've always wanted to contribute to the wonderful world of javascript games. There is just something about the liminal aesthetic of bare html and javascript that allows games like these to activate the player's sense of curiosity and wonder like nothing else.
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of the technical aspects of the project, I will be using this as an opportunity to further solidify my fluency in javascript, as well as teach myself how to store and retrieve local data in the browser and get data about the global time.
			</p>
			<p>
				My current idea is to theme the game around the life of a web developer. It will cover the entirety of your character's life, from a single cell, to adolescence, to college, to entering the industry, to inventing some new groundbreaking technology, to building a trillion dollar empire off of aggressive marketing and exploitation, to death, and gameplay will evolve over different stages of life. I will not be able to finish the entire game in the time allotted for this project, but I will aim to have a polished demo of about 15 minutes or so of gameplay. This is a project I can see myself continuing after the end of this course.
